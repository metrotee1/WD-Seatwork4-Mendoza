                [Intro]
                Psst, I see dead people
                (Mustard on the beat, ho)
                <br>
                <br>
                [Verse 1]
                Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
                Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
                Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
                Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
                What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
                The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
                How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
                I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
                Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
                Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
                Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
                Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
                Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
                Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
                You better not ever go to cell block one
                To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
                Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
                They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
                And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
                And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
                Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
                Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
                Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
                Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
                Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
                <br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                <br>
                <br>
                [Verse 2]
                You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
                I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
                Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'
                What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go
                The audience not dumb
                Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
                Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
                Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
                Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
                Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
                You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
                What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
                Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
                Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
                Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
                And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
                Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
                Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
                I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
                From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
                And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
                That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
                I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
                Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
                Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
                Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
                How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
                One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
                Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
                Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
                Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
                City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
                <br>
                <br>
                [Chorus]
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
                <br>
                <br>
                [Verse 3]
                Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
                Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
                Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
                Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
                The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
                Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
                You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
                Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
                You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
                Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
                21 gave you false street cred
                Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
                Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
                2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
                You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
                No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
                The family matter and the truth of the matter
                It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
                <br>
                <br>
                [Bridge]
                Mm
                Mm-mm
                He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
                He a fan, he a fan, he a
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
                Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
                Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
                Then step this way, step that way
                Then step this way, step that way
                <br>
                <br>
                [Outro]
                Are you my friend?
                Are we locked in?
                Then step this way, step that way
                Then step this way, step that way

            <p class="feature-description">
                "Not Like Us" is a diss track written and recorded by the American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was released on May 4, 2024, via Interscope Records, amidst his feud with the Canadian rapper Drake. It is Lamar's fifth installment in his series of diss tracks directed at Drake; it premiered fewer than 24 hours after his previous single, "Meet the Grahams".

                Primarily produced by Mustard, with additional work from Sounwave and Sean Momberger, "Not Like Us" is a hyphy-influenced West Coast hip hop song composed of a prominent bassline with lively brass instruments and finger snaps. Its lyrics continue the themes introduced in "Meet the Grahams" by doubling down on allegations against Drake of pedophilia and sexual misconduct, while also accusing him of exploiting Atlanta's music and cultural scenes for street credibility and financial benefits. Lamar first performed "Not Like Us" during The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, where he played the track five consecutive times.

                "Not Like Us" was met with widespread acclaim from music critics, who mainly viewed the single as Lamar's victory lap as his feud with Drake started to wind down. Complex named it the best track in their conflict, while other publications listed it among the greatest diss tracks ever made. Commercially, "Not Like Us" broke several streaming records and debuted atop the US Billboard Hot 100, marking Lamar's fourth number-one single and his second of 2024 after "Like That". It also reached the top spot in South Africa and peaked in the top 20 in Australia, Canada, and countries across Europe.

                The music video for "Not Like Us", directed by Dave Free and Lamar, was released on American Independence Day. It received critical acclaim, with many publications and websites hailing it as another victory lap for Lamar in the feud. It reached over 13 million views by the morning after its release on YouTube.
